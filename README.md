    # Arithmetic with ‚ú® Machine Learning ‚ú®
    A *silly* use-case of machine learning model. Watch **ML** ‚ö° in _action!_ 
</p>


## What is it?
Implementation of simple arithmetic operations‚Äîmultiplication, addition, and subtraction‚Äîon an array of natural numbers with a single-neuron deep learning network (basically _linear regression!_). 

`main` branch consists of manual implementation of the model with **numpy**.

`pytorch` branch implements the above model using the **pytorch** library.

## üöÄ Open with Streamlit
Visualise the gradient descent and linear regression happening right in front of you on your browser. Tune the hyperparamters as you watch your model **learn** *live!*

## üí≠ About the model
A single neuron deep learning neural network with identity activation function; in other words, *linear regression*. 

**Input** `1,2,3,...,n`  
**Target** `c,2c,3c,...nc`, *where c is a constant operand*

### ‚öôÔ∏è Training 
Steps in each epoch:

1. **Forward propagation**  
Computes the standard equation `w*X + b` in forward propagation. Identity activation function.

2. **Loss computation**  
Calculates Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss at the end of the forward propagation.

3. **Back propagation**  
Gradient of loss function with respect to weight `w` and bias `b` obtained: `dw` and `db` respectively.

4. **Gradient descent**  
Updates weight and bias by stepping against the gradient direction in the magnitude of learning rate `lr`.
    ```
    w' = w - lr*dw
    b' = b - lr*db
    ```
Since training dataset is small, batch size is the full training set.

### üèÅ Validation
Predicts targets for numbers in validation set using the final weight and bias, then reports validation loss.
