    A <i>silly</i> use-case of machine learning model. Watch <b>ML</b> ⚡ in <i>action!</i> 
</p>


## 🤔 What is it?
Implementation of simple arithmetic operations—multiplication, addition, and subtraction—on an array of natural numbers with a single-neuron deep learning network (basically _linear regression!_). 

`main` branch consists of manual implementation of the model with **numpy**.

`pytorch` branch implements the above model using the **pytorch** library.

## ℹ️ About the model
A single neuron deep learning neural network with identity activation function; in other words, *linear regression*. 

**Input** `1,2,3,...,n`  
**Target** `c,2c,3c,...nc`, *where c is a constant operand*

### ⚙️ Training 
Steps in each epoch:

1. **Forward propagation** ➡️  
Computes the standard equation `w*X + b` in forward propagation. Identity activation function.

2. **Loss computation** ⚠️  
Calculates Mean Squared Error (MSE) loss at the end of the forward propagation.

3. **Back propagation** ⬅️  
Gradient of loss function with respect to weight `w` and bias `b` obtained: `dw` and `db` respectively.

4. **Gradient descent** 📉  
Updates weight and bias by stepping against the gradient direction in the magnitude of learning rate `lr`.
    ```
    w' = w - lr*dw
    b' = b - lr*db
    ```
Since training dataset is small, batch size is the full training set.

### 🏁 Validation
Predicts targets for numbers in validation set using the final weight and bias, then reports validation loss.
